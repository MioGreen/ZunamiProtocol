# Zunami Protocol
Zunami Protocol is the first automated asset manager that works only with stablecoins. Our main priority is to create an absolutely safe and a more profitable alternative to bank deposits.

## How it works
We allocate usersâ€™ money over five different DeFi projects across several blockchains and we automatically sell rewards and re-invest profits so that users can enjoy all the power of compound interest.

## Technical details
Our project consists of three main entities:
### 1. Vault
Vault is the main mechanism for dealing with stable coins. We accept coins such as DAI, USDC and USDT from users. Using this functionality, the user can deposit or withdraw his money.

### 2. Strategies
Strategies are a mechanism for interacting with the protocols of our partners such as Curve, Yearn and others. The strategies also have functionality for insuring the deposits of our users.

### 3. Controller
A controller is a code that allows to add or remove strategies, insurance and fine-tune the functionality of the entire system.
